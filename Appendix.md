*Patent Treachery (Modified BSD License)
    To understand patent treachery, I think you need to look at the exact wording of the Apache 2.0 licence and the definition of "The Clear BSD License":
 
The Clear BSD License (#clearbsd)
 
    This is a free software license, compatible with both GPLv2 and GPLv3. It is based on the modified BSD license, and adds a term expressly stating it does not grant you any patent licenses. Because of this, we encourage you to be careful about using software under this license; you should first consider whether the licensor might want to sue you for patent infringement. If the developer is refusing users patent licenses to set up a trap for you, it would be wise to avoid the program.
 
Apache License, Version 2.0 (#apache2)
This is a free software license, compatible with version 3 of the GNU GPL.
Please note that this license is not compatible with GPL version 2, because it has some requirements that are not in the that GPL version. These include certain patent termination and indemnification provisions. The patent termination provision is a good thing, which is why we recommend the Apache 2.0 license for substantial programs over other lax permissive licenses.
Apache License, Version 2.0
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
 
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
From the above wording, it appears that patent treachery could refer to:
1.  the situation where a licensor who owns certain patent rights in respect of the software as well as copyright rights in respect to the software and chooses to licences only the copyright rights but not the patent rights, which means that if a person (user of the license) uses the software, then the owner could sue that person for patent breach (the treachery)
 
Or
 
2. the situation where a licensee of software claims patent rights, obtained by patenting some of the software code, and raises a patent infringement claim against the licensor of the copyright in the software.
 
People who are at the leading edge of ‘Free’ software, ie the software engineers who work on and create such code, are always highly suspicious of and very wary of any patent claims in respect of any software code, because it is so difficult to determine if a piece of code is the subject of a patent claim.  The Free software licenses were developed to ‘liberate’ software from the usual commercial copyright EULAs and were originally developed before most patent law began to recognise the patentability of software as software (rather than post solution development), so the very idea of patented software is, in many ways, ‘treachery’ to concept that these software engineers were trying to create.  Therefore if a licence appears to be a ‘free’ GPL GNU type licence, but could be used to trap a licensed user into a patent infringement claim, this would be treachery; as would a person who licences such GNU GPL software which license includes a Patent licence (such as Apache 2.0) but then turns around and sues the licensor for patent breach at the same time as making use the ‘free’ patent licence to use the software.  This would amount to treachery in the eyes of the software engineer.
 
I don’t think that ‘patent treachery’ is a precise legal term, rather it is a situation in which the software engineering ‘society’ feels betrayed by users/lawyers who betray the underlying idea of ‘free’ software by using patent law to claim rights.
